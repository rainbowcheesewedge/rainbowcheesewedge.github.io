        <h2>MATCHA WHITE HOT COCOA</h2>
        <p>
            Imagine the creamiest white hot cocoa infused with a strong 
            shot of matcha—this drink is like a cozy hug in a mug!
            The balance of sweet white chocolate and earthy matcha 
            is pure magic, with every sip bringing warmth and comfort.

        <h2>MAKING THE WHITE HOT COCOA BASE</h2>
        <p>
            Start by heating your milk gently in a saucepan over 
            low to medium heat. White chocolate is the secret to
            a rich and velvety cocoa base, so add pieces of 
            white chocolate and stir as it melts slowly into 
            the milk. Keep stirring, and make sure the heat 
            stays low—too much heat can cause the milk to 
            scald or the chocolate to separate. For that 
            perfect hint of extra flavor, add a splash of 
            vanilla extract, and don't forget a pinch of salt,
            which will balance the sweetness and bring out all 
            the subtle flavors of the chocolate.
        </p>

        <p>
            To keep the cocoa base smooth and luscious, avoid bringing it to
            a full boil. White chocolate is delicate, so just keep it warm 
            enough to fully melt and blend. If you'd like a thicker 
            consistency, you could add a bit of heavy cream or half-and-half
            along with the milk.
        </p>

        <h2>PREPARING THE MATCHA SHOTS</h2>
        <p> 
            Matcha is a special addition here, and the key to a perfect 
            shot is getting a smooth, clump-free blend. Begin by sifting 
            the matcha powder into a small bowl. Each drink calls for 
            about 4 to 5 grams of matcha powder, whisked with roughly
            40 to 50 grams of warm water. It's essential to use water 
            that's warm but not too hot (around 150°F is ideal); 
            using boiling water can make matcha taste bitter or
            metallic.
        </p>

        <p>
            Whisk the sifted matcha with warm water, using a bamboo whisk
            if you have one, or a small electric frother for the 
            perfect texture. Whisk in a “W” motion until you see 
            a smooth, foamy layer on top of the matcha. This 
            frothy shot adds a beautiful layer of flavor when 
            poured into the cocoa base, giving a delicate, earthy 
            undertone along with a caffeine kick to the sweet, creamy
            drink.
        </p>

        <h2>ASSEMBLING YOUR MATCHA WHITE HOT CHOCOLATE</h2>
        <p>
            Now that you have your white hot cocoa and matcha shot
            ready, it's time to bring the two together! Start by
            filling each mug about two-thirds of the way with the
            white-hot cocoa base. Then, slowly pour the matcha shot on top.
            For a gorgeous presentation, let the drink sit with the matcha 
            and white chocolate layers, or give it a gentle stir to create 
            a soft swirl of green and white.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you want a more intense matcha flavor, you can add another 
            half-shot, whisked separately, on top.
        </p>

        <h2>TOPPING IDEAS: CREAM FOAM OR TOASTED MARSHMALLOWS</h2>

        <p>
            To add even more indulgence, try topping your drink with a 
            soft, luscious cream foam. Simply whisk some heavy cream with a 
            splash of milk, vanilla extract, and white sugar until it's thick 
            but not fully whipped. You're aiming for a thick foam that will sit
            on top of the cocoa without sinking or becoming too stiff.
        </p>

        <p>
            If marshmallows are more your style, top the drink with a handful 
            of mini marshmallows and carefully toast them with a kitchen torch 
            until they're golden brown and just a little gooey. Toasted 
            marshmallows add a hint of smokey caramel-like flavor, which pairs
            perfectly with the white chocolate's sweetness.
        </p>

        <h2>TIPS FOR LEFTROVERS, MAKING AHEAD & VARIATIONS</h2>

        <p>
            While this Matcha White Hot Cocoa is best enjoyed fresh, you 
            can save any extra cocoa base and matcha separately in the fridge 
            for up to a day. When you're ready to enjoy it again, gently reheat
            the cocoa base over low heat, stirring to keep it smooth. The 
            matcha shot may settle in the fridge, so give it a quick whisk 
            before adding it to the warmed cocoa.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you're making a larger batch for guests, prepare the 
            white-hot cocoa base in advance and keep it warm on the 
            stovetop over very low heat. Prepare the matcha shots just before 
            serving to keep their flavor fresh and vibrant.
        </p>

        <p>
            Cozy, rich, and with that beautiful balance of sweet and earthy, 
            this Matcha White Hot Cocoa is the ultimate drink to warm you
            up on a chilly day. Each sip brings you the soft richness of white 
            chocolate and the comforting flavor of matcha, all topped off with 
            your favorite toppings for an extra treat.

        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>    
                <b>Prepare the White Hot Cocoa:</b> 
                In a medium saucepan
                over low to medium heat, combine the milk, white chocolate, 
                vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. Stir constantly 
                until the chocolate is fully melted and the mixture is
                smooth and hot, but avoid boiling. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>    
                <b>Make the Matcha:</b> 
                Add warm water into a mixing bowl. Sift the matcha powder
                on top to avoid clumps. Whisk all together until 
                smooth and frothy, using a bamboo whisk or small 
                electric whisk in an M or W motion.
            </li>
            <li>    
                <b>Assemble:</b> 
                Pour the white hot cocoa into serving cups, 
                filling each about two-thirds of the way. 
                Add a matcha shot on top, gently stirring 
                to create a beautiful swirl.
            </li>
            <li>    
                <b>Top with Cream Foam or Marshmallows (Optional):</b> 
                For the cream foam, whisk heavy cream with a splash of 
                milk, vanilla extract, and sugar until thick but not 
                stiff; avoid overwhipping. Spoon a dollop of this soft
                foam over each drink and sift matcha powder on top. 
                Alternatively, top with mini marshmallows and carefully
                toast them with a kitchen torch until golden brown for
                a toasty finish.
