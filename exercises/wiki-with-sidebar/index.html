                    <span>Pokemon</span> is a Japanese media franchise 
                    consisting of video games, animated series and films, 
                    a trading card game, and other related media. The franchise
                    takes place in a shared universe in which humans co-exist 
                    with creatures known as Pokémon, a large variety of 
                    species endowed with special powers. The franchise's 
                    primary target audience is children aged 5 to 12,[2] 
                    but it is known to attract people of all ages.[I]
                </p>
                <p>
                    The franchise originated as a pair of role-playing games 
                    developed by Game Freak, from an original concept by its 
                    founder, Satoshi Tajiri. Released on the Game Boy on 27 
                    February 1996, the games became sleeper hits and were 
                    followed by manga series, a trading card game, and anime 
                    series and films. From 1998 to 2000, Pokémon was exported 
                    to the rest of the world, creating an unprecedented global
                    phenomenon dubbed "Pokémania". By 2002, the craze had 
                    ended, after which Pokémon became a fixture in popular
                    culture, with new products being released to this day.
                    In the summer of 2016, the franchise spawned a second 
                    craze with the release of Pokémon Go, an augmented 
                    reality game developed by Niantic. Pokémon has since 
                    been estimated to be the world's highest-grossing media
                    franchise and one of the best-selling video game 
                    franchises.

                    Pokémon has an uncommon ownership structure.[11] Unlike 
                    most IPs, which are owned by one company, Pokémon is 
                    jointly owned by three: Nintendo, Game Freak, and 
                    Creatures.[1] Game Freak develops the core series 
                    role-playing games, which are published by Nintendo 
                    exclusively for their consoles, while Creatures manages 
                    the trading card game and related merchandise, occasionally
                    developing spin-off titles. The three companies established
                    The Pokémon Company (TPC) in 1998 to manage the Pokémon 
                    property within Asia. The Pokémon anime series and films 
                    are co-owned by Shogakukan. Since 2009, The Pokémon 
                    Company International (TPCi), a subsidiary of TPC, 
                    has managed the franchise in all regions outside 
                    Asia.[12][13]

                    The original full name of the franchise is Pocket 
                    Monsters (ポケットモンスター, Poketto Monsutā), which 
                    has been commonly abbreviated to Pokemon (ポケモン) 
                    since its launch. When the franchise was released 
                    internationally, the short form of the title was 
                    used, with an acute accent (´) over the e to aid 
                    in pronunciation.[14] As a Japanese word composed 
                    of English loanwords, the word Pokémon is an example
                    of a wasei-eigo.[15]: 30

                    Pokémon refers to both the franchise itself and the
                    creatures within its fictional universe. As a noun,
                    it is identical in both the singular and plural,
                    as is every individual species name;[16]
                    it is grammatically correct to say
                    "one Pokémon" and "many Pokémon",
                    as well as "one Pikachu" and "many Pikachu".[17]

                    The Pokémon franchise is set in a world in which humans 
                    coexist with creatures known as Pokémon. Pokémon Red 
                    and Blue contain 151 Pokémon species, with new ones 
                    being added in subsequent games; as of January 2024, 
                    1,025 Pokémon species have been introduced.[c] Most 
                    Pokémon are inspired by real-world animals or mythical
                    creatures based on real-life folklore.[18] For example,
                    Pikachu are a yellow mouse-like species[19] with 
                    lightning bolt-shaped tails[20] that possess electrical 
                    abilities.[21]

                    The player character takes the role of a Pokémon Trainer. 
                    The Trainer has three primary goals: travel and explore 
                    the Pokémon world; discover and catch each Pokémon species 
                    in order to complete their Pokédex; and train a team of up 
                    to six Pokémon at a time and have them engage in Pokémon 
                    battles. Most Pokémon can be caught with spherical devices
                    known as Poké Balls. Once the opposing Pokémon is 
                    sufficiently weakened, the Trainer throws the Poké Ball 
                    against the Pokémon, which is then transformed into a 
                    form of energy and transported into the device. Once 
                    the catch is successful, the Pokémon is tamed and is 
                    under the Trainer's command from then on. If the Poké 
                    Ball is thrown again, the Pokémon re-materializes into 
                    its original state. The Trainer's Pokémon can engage in 
                    battles against opposing Pokémon, including those in the 
                    wild or owned by other Trainers. Because the franchise is 
                    aimed at children, these battles are never presented as 
                    overtly violent and contain no blood or gore.[II] Pokémon 
                    never die in battle – they faint upon being defeated, and 
                    can then be rejuvenated at a Pokémon Center.[III]

                <h4>Origins</h4>
                <p>
                    The main idea behind Pokémon was conceived by Satoshi 
                    Tajiri.
                    Tajiri was born on 28 August 1965,[35] and grew up in 
                    Machida, a suburb of Tokyo.[36] As a child, he enjoyed 
                    discovering and catching insects and other small creatures
                    in the various ponds and fields that surrounded his town.
                    [37][38] During Japan's economic miracle, many cities, 
                    including Machida, were significantly expanded. As a 
                    consequence, Machida's nature was largely destroyed. 
                    In his second year of junior high school,[39][40] an 
                    arcade hall opened in Tajiri's neighborhood, introducing 
                    him to video games. While studying electrical engineering
                    at Tokyo College of Technology [ja], Tajiri began 
                    publishing a doujinshi magazine titled Game Freak. 
                    The title was inspired by the 1932 film Freaks, 
                    which Tajiri was fascinated with at the time.[41] 
                    He self-published the first issue of the magazine 
                    in March 1983, at the age of 17.[42][43] At the 
                    time, magazines specializing in video games did 
                    not yet exist in Japan, allowing Game Freak to fill 
                    a gap in the market.[44][45] Sometime later, Tajiri was
                    contacted by aspiring manga artist Ken Sugimori, 
                    who became Game Freak's illustrator.[46] Game Freak 
                    folded in the late 1980s,[42] by which point Tajiri 
                    had become a respected game journalist in Japan's 
                    fledgling video game industry.[47]

                <h4>Video Games</h4>
                <p>
                    Pokémon video games have been released in a wide variety 
                    of genres. The role-playing games (RPGs) developed by 
                    Game Freak are considered the core series of the franchise.
                    [455][456][457] Various spin-off games also exist, 
                    such as Pokémon Mystery Dungeon, a roguelike RPG series,
                    Pokémon Ranger, an action RPG series, and Detective Pikachu
                    (2018), an adventure game. Pokémon games, in particular 
                    the core RPGs, are commonly classified in generations. 
                    For example, Junichi Masuda referred to Diamond and Pearl 
                    (2006) as Gen 4,[458] and X and Y (2013) as the 6th 
                    generation.[459]
                </p>
                <h3 id="reaction">Reaction to Pokémania (1999-2000)</h3>
                <p>
                    In 1999 and 2000, Pokémon was an unprecedented, ubiquitous
                    fad in the Western world. Time magazine described it as 
                    "a multimedia and interactive barrage like no other before 
                    it".[26] The franchise, primarily aimed at children, 
                    elicited mixed responses from parents and teachers, 
                    some of them critical. Yano (2004) even claimed that 
                    the reactions at one point constituted a moral panic.[475]
                    The bulk of the criticism on Pokémon was directed at the 
                    trading cards,[476] in particular the booster packs, sealed
                    packages of 11[f] randomly inserted cards that were sold 
                    separately from the main sets. The cards are of varying 
                    scarcity, the most valuable being the "holofoil cards" 
                    (also called "holographic" or "foil cards"), in which 
                    the illustrations of the Pokémon have a shiny overlay 
                    effect. The rare cards can only be found in booster 
                    packs, and the rarest ones are very infrequently 
                    included. Tobin (2004) notes that rarity in this case 
                    is "artificially created", and "effectively a form of 
                    gambling" in which children need to repeatedly purchase 
                    booster packs to get more rare cards.[477] Brougère [fr] 
                    (2004) described a cynicism among adults that corporations
                    could apparently, "out of thin air", ascribe value to cards 
                    which they saw as valueless, thereby "deceiving vulnerable 
                    young consumers and garnering excessive profits".[476]
                </p>
                <h3 id="legacy">Legacy and influences</h3>
                <p>
                    After World War II, Japan experienced a period of 
                    unprecedented growth and became well-known in the Western 
                    world for its consumer products, such as radios (e.g. 
                    Panasonic, Toshiba), cars (e.g. Toyota, Mitsubishi), 
                    and Sony's Walkman.[530] From 1991 onwards, its economy
                    stagnated, causing the country to lose its status as 
                    an economic superpower. However, during the 1990s and
                    2000s, Japan re-emerged as a source of 'cool' cultural 
                    goods, embraced by a growing international audience 
                    interested in Japanese culture.[XII] Nintendo, Sega, 
                    and Sony launched several popular video game consoles 
                    and franchises.[244][535][536] In terms of children's 
                    properties, the success of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers 
                    changed perceptions on the viability of such Japanese 
                    imports in the West.[537][538][539] The Tamagotchi fad 
                    (1997–98),[540] centered around a portable digital pet 
                    device, was said to have "paved the way for Pokémon".[243]
