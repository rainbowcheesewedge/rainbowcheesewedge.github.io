        <ul>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>2 cups evaporated milk</li>
            <li>6 to 8 cardamom pods, lightly crushed</li>
            <li>3 cinnamon sticks</li>
            <li>1 ginger cube (or a small piece of fresh ginger)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup light brown sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>4 black/red tea bags</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a medium pot, combine the water, evaporated milk, 
                cardamom pods, cinnamon sticks, and ginger. Bring the mixture 
                to a gentle boil over medium heat.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Once it starts bubbling, reduce the heat to low and let it 
                simmer for about 5 to 7 minutes. This allows the spices to 
                infuse the milk and water with their rich, warm flavors.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Place the tea bags into the pot and let them steep for 3 to 5 
                minutes, depending on how strong you like your tea. Stir 
                occasionally to help the tea blend with the spiced milk. 
                You'll know it's ready when the color turns a deep, caramel
                brown. Stir in the brown sugar until it dissolves completely.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Add the vanilla extract and let it simmer for another minute 
                to enhance the flavor.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Remove the pot from the heat and carefully strain the tea into
                cups to remove the spices and tea bags.
            </li>

            <li>
                Serve hot and enjoy!

            <h6>PREPARE THE HOT COCOA:</h6>
            <li>
                In a medium saucepan, combine evaporated milk,
                regular milk, and heavy cream over medium heat.

            <h6>MAKE THE MARSHMALLOW FLUFF:</h6>

                In a mixing bowl, add egg whites and cream of tartar. 
                Whisk until the mixture becomes bubbly and foamy.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                In a saucepan, combine water, sugar, and corn syrup. 
                Heat over medium heat, stirring until the 
                sugar dissolves.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Allow the mixture to simmer without stirring further, 
                until it reaches about 240°F or 115°C using a candy
